How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It is a lot more efficient than doing it manually.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It is easier to change back the way it was if you made a mistake.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually choosing when to commit have one clear, logical purpose and much
    easier to compare versions while having versions automatically saved is
    you don't know what you did on that version.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because they are related and logical, unlike others that save automatically.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can use it to see the things that I have changed and to compare files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I am more confident to make changes because I could easily see the changes
    that I've made.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    My all upcoming projects.
