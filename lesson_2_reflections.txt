What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	To create a repository so I can commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	
	It bundles the entire contents of the staging area and adds that to the
	repository. It holds the content so you can commit one per logical change
	instead of committing individually.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	
	I can use it to compare the changes that I have made by using git diff
	and git diff --staged.
