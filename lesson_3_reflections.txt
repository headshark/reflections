When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
	
	When developing projects with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	Because you have control.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
	
	Clones are copying of the repository. Forks are like clone but for GitHub
	only while branches diverge you from the master of the repository. I would
	use clones for copying a local repository while forks for copying on GitHub
	and branches for experiments or making really big changes.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
	
	For knowing if you are ahead or behind.
